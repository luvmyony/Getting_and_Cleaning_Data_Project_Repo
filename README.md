## How run_analysis.R code script works

Each of the followings is the step I work in run_analysis.R code script to make a tidy dataset from the raw dataset. 

The raw dataset is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone for group of 30 volunteers.  

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 

4. Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

5. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.

6. Writing into a txt file.
